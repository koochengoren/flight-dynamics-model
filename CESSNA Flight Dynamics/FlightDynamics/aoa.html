<H2><a href="#sec-aoa-intro">2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Importance of Angle of Attack</H2>Angle of attack is a very important and useful concept.
 Most of the airplane's critical performance numbers are more
closely related to angle of attack than to anything else. Let's
explore what this means.<BR>
<BR>
You've probably heard that it is good to fly<A NAME="@default113"></A> the airplane ``by the numbers''. The
question is, <EM>what</EM> numbers?<BR>
<BR>
Suppose we wish to achieve the best rate of climb:<BR>
<BR>
<DL COMPACT=compact>
<DT>
 A)<DD> You could try to control the airplane by reference
to the ``rate of climb'' number shown on the vertical
speed indicator. This is not recommended!
<DT>B)<DD> It would be better to maintain <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>Y</FONT></SUB>,
the nominal best-rate-of-climb speed, as shown on the airspeed
indicator, and accept whatever rate of climb results. This is
almost exactly the right idea.
<DT>C)<DD> It would be even better to realize that the best
rate of climb is achieved at a particular angle of attack. In
particular, if the airplane is lightly loaded compared to what
was anticipated in the handbook, the best rate of climb will be
achieved at a lower speed than is reflected in the handbook's
<I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>Y</FONT></SUB> value.
</DL>This is not an isolated example. Many of the airplane's
critical performance numbers are really angle of attack numbers:
<DL COMPACT=compact>
<DT>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE=symbol>Þ</FONT><DD> The stall occurs at a particular angle of attack.
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE=symbol>Þ</FONT><DD> The smallest power-off descent rate occurs at
a particular angle of attack.

angle of attack.

</DL>Here is a summary of the main ideas that will be
explained in this chapter: 
<UL>
<LI> The airplane is trimmed for a definite angle
of attack. The ``pitch'' trim wheel is really an angle
of attack selector. 
<LI> Push/pull motion<A NAME="@default114"></A>
of the yoke can be viewed as an extension of the trim wheel &#8212;
just another way of controlling angle of attack. It is very difficult
to stall the airplane unless you pull back on the yoke and/or
apply lots of nose-up trim. This idea could save your
neck.
<LI> Outside visual references also provide information
about angle of attack, if you know what to look for. 
<LI> The airspeed indicator provides quantitative
information about angle of attack, when the 
airspeed is not too low. Correction factors must be
applied to correct for nonstandard weight and/or <I>G</I>-loads.
<LI> Configuration and power changes have minor effects
on the trimmed angle of attack.

<H2><a href="#sec-def-aoa">2.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of Angle of Attack</H2>I will now explain what angle of attack is, why it
is important, and how it is related to things a pilot can actually
observe and control.<BR>
<BR>
The basic idea is simple: the angle of attack<A NAME="@default120"></A> is the angle at which the air hits the wing.
 The Wright brothers<A NAME="@default121"></A> had only one flight
instrument on their first airplane &#8212; an angle of attack
instrument. It was all they needed.<BR>
<BR>
Their angle of attack indicator<A NAME="@default122"></A>
consisted of a stick attached to the wing, with a piece of yarn
dangling from the front end, as indicated in <A HREF="#fig-aoa-def2">figure 2.1</A>.
The yarn aligns itself with the relative wind.<A NAME="text25" HREF="#note25"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT></SUP></A> The stick serves as a
reference line, and also serves to locate the yarn in a region of air
that has not been too badly disturbed by the wing.<BR>
<BR>

<IMG SRC="../gif48/aoa-def2.gif" alt=aoa-def2 height=39 width=264><BR><A HREF="#fig-aoa-def2">Figure 2.1</A>: Simple Angle of Attack Instrument
</DIV>
<BR>
The angle between the stick and the yarn indicates
angle of attack. <BR>
<BR>
The exact alignment of the indicator stick relative to the airplane is
not critical. The most elegant scheme is to orient the stick in the
<EM>zero-lift direction</EM><A NAME="@default124"></A> so that zero angle of attack corresponds to
zero coefficient of lift<A NAME="@default125"></A>. That choice will be used throughout this
book; see <A HREF="#sec-raoa-aaoa">section 2.14</A> for a discussion of other
possibilities.<BR>
<BR>
Most aircraft do not have any instruments that give
the you a direct indication of angle of attack. Surprisingly,
many airliners and other aircraft that <EM>do</EM> have fancy angle-of-attack
sensors don't make the information available to the flight crew
&#8212; only to the autopilot. The bottom line is that most
pilots have to use a few tricks in order to perceive angle of
attack. We now discuss how this is done.<BR>
<BR>
It turns out to be easier to maintain <EM>some</EM> constant
angle of attack than to know precisely what angle of attack you've
got. The strategy is summarized in the following outline.<BR>
<BR>
<DL COMPACT=compact>
<DT>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<DD> &#8212; There are several ways to maintain a constant
angle of attack. 
 <DL COMPACT=compact>
<DT>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1<DD> 
&#8211;
 The airplane is trimmed for a definite angle
of attack (see <A HREF="#sec-trim-aoa">section 2.3</A>). 
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2<DD> 
&#8211;
 You can perceive the angle of attack and regulate
it by hand. To perceive the angle
of attack, you need to compare 
the pitch attitude to the relative wind. 
 <DL COMPACT=compact>
<DT>
 1.2(a)<DD> 
&#8211;
 There are at least four ways to perceive the
pitch attitude (see <A HREF="#sec-perceive-pitch">section 2.5</A>).
<DT>1.2(b)<DD> 
&#8211;
 There are a couple of ways to estimate the 
direction of the relative wind (see <A HREF="#sec-perceive-wind">section 2.11</A>). 
 </DL>
 </DL>
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<DD> &#8212; You can use the airspeed and other considerations
to decide if you are maintaining the <EM>right</EM> angle of attack
(see <A HREF="#sec-ias-aoa">section 2.12</A>). 
</DL>Now let's investigate each of the items in this outline.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="toc20"></A><a name="sec_trim_aoa"></a><A NAME="sec-trim-aoa"></A>
<H2><a href="#sec-trim-aoa">2.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Trim for Angle of Attack!</H2>The simplest and best way to get the airplane to
fly at a constant angle of attack<A NAME="@default126"></A>
is to <EM>leave it alone! </EM> An airplane, by its very structure,
is trimmed for a definite angle of attack. The reason for this
is discussed in <A HREF="aoastab.html#sec-aoa-stability">chapter 6</A>. Even a dime-store
balsa-wood glider wants to fly at a definite angle of attack.<BR>
<BR>
This concept is so important that it is the focal
point of the first lesson I give student pilots, who sometimes
arrive with the misconception that pilots must use great skill
and continual intervention to keep the airplane under control.
 I trim the airplane for straight and level flight and then take
my hands off the controls, demonstrating that the airplane will
fly just fine for quite a while with no intervention at all. 
I emphasize a professional pilot does not grab the controls firmly
and move them quickly; a real pro grabs them lightly and moves
them smoothly<A NAME="@default127"></A>
<A NAME="@default128"></A>
.<BR>
<BR>
The second lesson is this: I trim the airplane for
a speed near <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>Y</FONT></SUB>, straight and level. I then
roll the trim wheel<A NAME="@default129"></A> back a little, which results
in a decrease in the trim speed. It does not result in a steady
climb. I explain that the trim wheel controls angle of attack,
and that airspeed is related to angle of attack. Trim for angle
of attack!<BR>
<BR>
To make changes in the angle of attack, you should
adjust the pitch attitude using pressure the yoke, then trim to
remove the pressure, as discussed in <A HREF="#sec-change-aoa">section 2.6</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Configuration changes can affect the airplane's preferred
angle of attack. In a Cessna 152, 172, or 182, if you extend
the flaps<A NAME="@default130"></A> <EM>while the
engine is at 
a high power setting</EM> or if you increase the power<A NAME="@default131"></A>
<EM>while the flaps are extended</EM> it will cause a nasty 
decrease in the trim speed. This is highly undesirable and dangerous
behavior. This means that when you perform a go-around, the airplane
tends to pitch up drastically and lose airspeed; to maintain
control you need to push on the yoke while you retract the flaps
and retrim. This pitch-up behavior is particularly treacherous
because it is not familiar. The trim speed<A NAME="@default132"></A> changes very little if you extend
the flaps at low power settings, and/or change the power with
the flaps retracted, so if you haven't recently performed many
go-arounds or similar maneuvers you might be in for a nasty surprise.<BR>
<BR>
For a typical Cherokee, extending two notches of flaps lowers the trim
speed ten or fifteen knots. This is discussed further in
<A HREF="vdamp.html#sec-effect-of-flaps">section 5.5</A> and <A HREF="landing.html#sec-nasty-go-around">section 12.10</A>. Increasing
or decreasing engine power<A NAME="@default133"></A> affects the trimmed angle
of attack only slightly. As discussed in <A HREF="energy.html#sec-change-throttle">section 1.3.2</A>,
if you just reduce power the airplane should just descend. It should
not slow down appreciably; in fact it will probably speed up a little.<BR>
<BR>
An advanced lesson serves to demonstrate that constant
angle of attack is not quite the same as constant airspeed. When
the airplane is subjected to a high <I>G</I>-loading, as in a
steep turn, the trim mechanism causes it to speed up, so that
it can support the increased load at the same angle of attack.
This is important, since (as discussed in <A HREF="aoastab.html#sec-spiral-dive">section 6.2</A>)
it helps explain graveyard spirals,<A NAME="@default134"></A> and why it
is a bit tricky to recover from them safely.<BR>

<H2><a href="#sec-incidence">2.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Three Contributions to Angle of Attack</H2>As mentioned earlier, it is difficult to directly
perceive angle of attack. Fortunately, there are three other
quantities that can be perceived, and together they determine
the angle of attack. They are:<UL>
<LI>
  Pitch attitude<A NAME="@default136"></A>, which is
defined<A NAME="text26" HREF="#note26"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>4</FONT></SUP></A> to be the 
angle that the fuselage makes relative to the horizontal.
<LI> Angle of climb<A NAME="@default137"></A>, which
is just the angle between the flight path and the horizontal.
<LI> Angle of incidence<A NAME="@default138"></A>, which is the angle at which
the wings are attached to the fuselage.
</UL>These quantities are related to the angle of attack
by a very simple formula:
<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TABLE CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=0>
<TR><TD ALIGN=center NOWRAP><TABLE CELLPADDING=10>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#ffffd8">
 Pitch Attitude + Incidence = Angle of Climb + Angle of Attack
</TD>
</TR></TABLE></TD>
</TR></TABLE>
</DIV><BR>
This relationship is illustrated in <A HREF="#fig-incidence">figure 2.2</A>.
Perhaps the simplest case is straight and level flight at cruise<A NAME="@default139"></A>
airspeed. In this case, the pitch attitude is zero, the angle of
climb is zero, and the angle of attack is equal to the angle of
incidence. Some more examples, with specific numbers for a typical
airplane, are included in <A HREF="#tab-various-angles">table 2.1</A>.<BR>

</DIV>
<BR>
Extending the flaps has the effect of increasing the
incidence<A NAME="text27" HREF="#note27"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>5</FONT></SUP></A> by several degrees. You need to be always
aware of what flap setting you are using, and to recognize the
distinction between ``pitch attitude'' and ``pitch attitude plus
incidence''. For any given flap setting, you can take the incidence
to be constant, whereupon angle of attack depends only on pitch
attitude and direction of flight.<BR>
<BR>
The table mentions <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>X</FONT></SUB> and <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>Y</FONT></SUB>, which denote the
airspeeds for best angle of climb and best rate of climb,
respectively, as discussed in <A HREF="power.html#sec-power-curve">section 7.5</A>. The
relationship of airspeed to angle of attack will be discussed in
<A HREF="#sec-ias-aoa">section 2.12</A>.<BR>

<H2><a href="#sec-perceive-pitch">2.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Perceiving Pitch Angle</H2>In straight and level flight you can control angle of attack by
controlling pitch attitude. You won't be able to pick a particular
angle of attack such as 6.37 degrees, but whatever angle of attack
you've got can be maintained.<A NAME="text28" HREF="#note28"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>6</FONT></SUP></A><BR>
<BR>
There are at least four ways of perceiving pitch attitude. Perhaps
the best way is to use a mark on the windshield<A NAME="@default145"></A>, as shown in
<A HREF="#fig-perceive-pitch-front">figure 2.3</A>. The line of sight from your eye
through the mark makes a good pointer. (Try not to move your head up
and down too much!) If you can't find a scratch or bug-corpse in
exactly the right place, you can <EM>make</EM> a mark, or a pair of
marks, as discussed in <A HREF="snaps.html#sec-coordination-front">section 11.5.2</A>. It is even
simpler to rest your hand atop the instrument panel, holding the tip
of your finger in the right place, as shown in <A HREF="snaps.html#fig-hud-finger">figure 11.2</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Suppose you identify (or make) the mark when the
airplane is flying at the angle of attack that corresponds to
<I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>Y</FONT></SUB>. Then if you re-trim for a higher angle
of attack<A NAME="text29" HREF="#note29"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>7</FONT></SUP></A> the sight line through that mark will point two
or three degrees above the horizon. Similarly, if you re-trim for
high-speed cruise, the sight mark will appear three or four degrees
below the horizon.<BR>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=center>

<IMG SRC="../gif48/perceive-pitch-front.gif" alt=perceive-pitch-front height=154 width=240><BR><A HREF="#fig-perceive-pitch-front">Figure 2.3</A>: Perceiving Pitch
Using The Forward Horizon
</DIV>
<BR>
The second way of perceiving pitch attitude also involves looking out
the front, but uses a sight line through a point on the
cowling<A NAME="@default146"></A>. This is also
indicated in <A HREF="#fig-perceive-pitch-front">figure 2.3</A>. Be sure you chose a
point on the cowling directly ahead of your
dominant<A NAME="text30" HREF="#note30"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>8</FONT></SUP></A> eye; if your seat
is way over on one side of the airplane and you choose a sight mark on
the middle of the cowling, your sight line will be angled sideways,
which will mess up your pitch attitude perception as soon as you try
to bank the airplane. A Cessna 152 or 172 has a bolt on the cowling,
directly ahead of the pilot, that makes a good sight mark.<BR>
<BR>
A sight mark on the cowling<A NAME="@default147"></A> has the advantage that it is farther away
from your eye, so it is easier to keep both it and the horizon
in focus at the same time. The disadvantage is that the sight
line constructed this way sometimes points quite a ways below the
horizon. This means the angle you are trying to perceive &#8212; the
angle between this reference line and the relative wind &#8212;
is larger. It is always harder to perceive a small change in something
large than a small change in something that was small to begin
with.<BR>
<BR>
Using the cowling has one big advantage over using
marks on the windshield: the cowling is a permanent part of the
airplane and is in the same place on all airplanes of that make
and model.<BR>
<BR>
The third way to perceive pitch attitude is to observe
the angle between the wing and the lateral horizon, as shown in
<A HREF="#fig-perceive-pitch-lateral">figure 2.4</A>. On a high-wing airplane,
the bottom surface of the wing<A NAME="@default148"></A> makes a good reference. In
particular, on a Cessna 
152 / 172 / 182, the bottom surface has a rather large flat section,
which makes an ideal reference &#8212; and this reference is
very nearly aligned with the horizon at cruise angle of attack
(in level flight).<BR>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=center>

Lateral Horizon
</DIV>
 <BR>
On a low-wing airplane, you typically have to use
a little more imagination to use the wing as a reference pointer
&#8212; but it is definitely possible and definitely worth the
effort. Sometimes it helps to envision the chord line with your
mind's eye. If you control the angle between the chord line and
the lateral horizon, you are controlling pitch attitude.<BR>
<BR>
The idea that you can control pitch attitude while
looking out the side<A NAME="@default149"></A> window is very
important. Aerobatics pilots often attach crosshair-like pointers
to their wings, just so they can be sure to have an easy-to-use
pitch attitude reference when they're looking out the side. Conversely,
it is common to find students who (although they can fly OK while
looking out the front) lose control of pitch as soon as they try
to look out the side; this makes it tough to check landmarks or
scan for traffic.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="@default150"></A>
The fourth way of perceiving pitch attitude is to use the attitude
indicator instrument &#8212; the artificial horizon<A NAME="@default151"></A>. This has the
drawback that it is much too close to your eye; you can't look at the
attitude indicator and look for traffic at the same time. You should
use outside pitch references whenever possible.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="toc23"></A><a name="sec_change_aoa"></a><A NAME="sec-change-aoa"></A>
<H2><a href="#sec-change-aoa">2.6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Making Changes in Angle of Attack</H2>The push/pull motion of the yoke and the
trim wheel are part of the same system, jointly controlling the angle
of attack. They also jointly control airspeed, as discussed in
<A HREF="#sec-ias-aoa">section 2.12</A>.<BR>
<BR>
If you want to make a temporary increase in angle of
attack, just raise the
nose by applying a little back pressure on the yoke. When you reach
the new pitch attitude, you can release most of the pressure, and for
the first few moments the airplane will maintain the new pitch
attitude. Then, as it <A NAME="@default152"></A>decelerates, you will need to maintain progressively more
back pressure in order to maintain the new pitch attitude (and new
angle of attack). After a few seconds things will stabilize at a new
pitch attitude, a new angle of attack, and a new airspeed. At this
point, if you release the back pressure, the airplane will want to
drop its nose so it can return to its trimmed angle of attack.<BR>
<BR>
If you push or pull the airplane off its trim speed
and then suddenly let go of the yoke, the airplane will not return
smoothly and immediately to its trim speed; there will be some
phugoid oscillation (as discussed in <A HREF="aoastab.html#sec-phugoid">section 6.1.12</A>). To
undo a temporary change in angle of attack, the proper technique
requires observing and controlling the pitch attitude. Let the
nose drop to the correct pitch attitude, then apply enough back
pressure to keep it from dropping farther. Then, as the airplane
gradually returns to its trim speed, you will need progressively
less pressure.<BR>
<BR>
Similar logic applies to making long-term changes in angle of attack.
Use the yoke to change the pitch attitude. At first very little
pressure will be required to maintain the new pitch attitude. Then,
as the airspeed changes, use pressure on the yoke to keep the attitude
where you want it. Make the change permanent by using the
trim wheel to trim off the applied pressure.<BR>
<BR>
Let's see how these ideas apply to a typical maneuver: levelling
off<A NAME="@default153"></A> from a climb. Initially let's suppose you
start out nicely trimmed, climbing at 475 feet per minute at 90 knots
true airspeed.<A NAME="text31" HREF="#note31"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>9</FONT></SUP></A>
As discussed in <A HREF="#sec-perceive-wind">section 2.11</A>, that means
your direction of flight is 3 degrees above the horizon. As shown in
<A HREF="#fig-level-off">figure 2.5</A>, the first step in the level-off is to change
your direction of flight so it becomes horizontal. During the brief
time that the direction of flight is changing, the aircraft will be
out of equilibrium; lift will be less than weight. The load on the
aircraft and its occupants will be slightly less than one <I>G</I>.<BR>
<BR>

</DIV>
<BR>
As the direction of flight changes, you will need
to lower the nose the same amount (three degrees). At this point,
since the direction of flight and the pitch attitude have changed
together, the angle of attack is (for the moment) the same as
it was during the climb. This can be seen by comparing the top
two parts of <A HREF="#fig-aoa-change">figure 2.6</A>. The airspeed is still 90
knots, which is the trim speed, so no yoke force<A NAME="@default154"></A> will be needed to maintain the new attitude (for the
moment). So far so good.

</DIV>
<BR>
Now we need to think about the energy situation (as discussed in
<A HREF="energy.html#sec-powered-power-curve">section 1.3.1</A>). Since the airplane is no longer
climbing, the engine power<A NAME="@default155"></A> that
had previously been devoted to increasing the altitude is now being
devoted to increasing the airspeed. As the airplane gradually
accelerates from climb speed to cruise<A NAME="@default156"></A> speed, 
the direction of flight remains horizontal, so the pitch attitude will
gradually decrease as the angle of attack decreases. This is shown in
the bottom part of <A HREF="#fig-aoa-change">figure 2.6</A>. You will need to apply
progressively more forward 
pressure. You can trim off this pressure all at once, or trim
it off in stages during the acceleration.
<A NAME="text32" HREF="#note32"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>10</FONT></SUP></A>
 <BR>
Eventually, the airplane will reach cruise speed. At this point, the
airplane has all the altitude (potential energy) and airspeed (kinetic
energy) that it needs, so you should throttle back to cruise
power. Now<A NAME="text33" HREF="#note33"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>11</FONT></SUP></A>
you make your final trim adjustment and the level-off maneuver is
complete.<BR>
<BR>
Here is a useful trick: make a note of how much trim<A NAME="@default157"></A> change is required in your favorite airplane
to make the transition from climb to cruise. It is some definite
amount, and remembering this amount obviates a lot of guessing
and fiddling. I remember the amounts in terms of ``sectors''
and ``bumps''. That is, on most airplanes only a certain
sector of the trim wheel is exposed, and this defines how much
trim change can be achieved with a single hand motion; I call
this one sector. Similarly, the trim wheel typically features
a series of bumps, to make it easier to grasp. Each bump represents
1/4th or 1/5th of a sector.<BR>
<BR>
Suppose after cruising in level flight for a while, you decide to climb
to a higher altitude. If you roll in three sectors of nose-up 
trim<A NAME="@default158"></A> as you start the climb, you can
bet that you will need roll those three sectors back out to return
to cruise airspeed afterwards.<A NAME="text34" HREF="#note34"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>12</FONT></SUP></A><BR>
<BR>
Similarly, suppose you are cruising along and encounter
an updraft<A NAME="@default159"></A>. If you roll in half a bump of nose-down trim to help
you maintain altitude, you can bet that you will need to roll
that half-bump back out when you exit the updraft and return to
normal airspeed. Keep track of the amount! Say to yourself,
``I'm carrying a half-bump of nose-down trim which I'll have
to get rid of sooner or later''.<BR>

<H2><a href="#sec-light-touch-1">2.7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fly with a Light Touch</H2>Here's some really important advice: Fly with a light
touch. You need to feel if
you are pulling the airplane off its trim speed.<BR>
<BR>
Some airplanes have such heavy control forces that
it's hard to imagine anyone accidentally pulling the plane off
its trim speed. You need to trim it properly lest you wear yourself
out trying to hold the yoke. For some maneuvers (such as the
landing flare) you need to apply a significant amount of force
&#8212; but please be aware of what you are doing.<BR>
<BR>
Some other planes have such light control forces
that if you have the proverbial death grip on the yoke, you could
pull the airplane ten knots away from its trim speed without feeling
it.<BR>
<BR>
I once flew with a pilot who held the yoke so tightly
that his knuckles turned white, literally. Every time he looked
to the right, the airplane pitched down 10 or 15 degrees. Every
time he looked to the left, the airplane pitched up 10 or 15 degrees.
It's a good thing he didn't look to the left very long; otherwise
we might have stalled.<BR>
<BR>
For any plane, C-152 or Airbus, if you trim it properly
you will be able to fly most maneuvers using just your thumb and
one or two fingertips.<BR>
<BR>
The yoke is not just a control carrying commands
from you to the airplane &#8212; it is also a valuable sensor
carrying information from the airplane to you. This is discussed
in more detail in <A HREF="landing.html#sec-light-touch">section 12.12</A>.<BR>
<BR>
You should make sure the airplane is at all times
trimmed for the right airspeed (or, rather, angle of attack).
 You should be aware of (and wary of) any force you apply to the
yoke, forcing the airplane off its trim speed.<BR>
<BR>
Fly with a light touch!<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="toc25"></A><a name="sec_trim_not_perfect"></a><A NAME="sec-trim-not-perfect"></A>
<H2><a href="#sec-trim-not-perfect">2.8</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Trim Won't Solve All The World's Problems</H2>Although the airplane's tendency to return to its trimmed angle of
attack is very powerful, very important, and usually very helpful,
there is more to the story.<BR>
<BR>
If the airplane is disturbed from its trimmed angle of attack, it will
not just return; it will overshoot. It will oscillate a few times
before settling down. These phugoid<A NAME="@default162"></A> oscillations are
slow enough that you can easily extinguish them by timely pressure on
the yoke, as discussed in <A HREF="aoastab.html#sec-phugoid">section 6.1.12</A>.<BR>
<BR>
In smooth air, you can trim the airplane and let it fly itself.
However, turbulent air will frequently provoke new phugoid
oscillations so you will frequently need to apply small nudges to the
yoke.<BR>
<BR>
For similar reasons, it is not normal procedure to
use the trim wheel to <EM>initiate</EM> a change in pitch attitude,
airspeed, or angle of attack. That would just provoke an oscillation.
Initiate the change with the yoke as described above. Put the pitch
attitude where it belongs, keep it there with the yoke, and then trim
off the pressure.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, in some airplanes the trim speed is perturbed when you add
power, when you extend flaps, and especially when you have power and
flaps at the same time. See <A HREF="vdamp.html#sec-effect-of-flaps">section 5.5</A> and
<A HREF="landing.html#sec-nasty-go-around">section 12.10</A>.<BR>

<A NAME="toc26"></A><a name="sec_leadville"></a><A NAME="sec-leadville"></A>
<H2><a href="#sec-leadville">2.9</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Pitch Attitude versus Angle of Attack</H2>The previous sections pointed out 
that while pitch attitude and angle of attack are related, they
are not quite the same. Pitch attitude is measured relative to
the horizon, but angle of attack involves the direction of the
relative wind. In any situation where the relative wind is not
horizontal, we have to be careful.<BR>
<BR>
I forgot the distinction once; let me tell you the
story. One summer I spent several weeks at the Aspen Center for
Physics. This was my first opportunity to do any mountain
flying<A NAME="@default163"></A>, so I arranged for a lesson from the
flight school at Aspen. The
lesson included flying over the continental divide and landing
at Leadville. Leadville is famous for being
the highest airport in the United States &#8212; 9900 feet above
sea level. On the day in question, it was about 90<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE=symbol>°</FONT></FONT></SUP>F in the shade,
so the density altitude at Leadville was around 13,000 feet, and
I knew takeoff<A NAME="@default164"></A> performance would be critical.
<BR>
I used my best short-field procedure, even though
the runway was 5000 feet long. I accelerated on the runway to
the proper climb-out speed (75 knots indicated, 90 knots true)
and then rotated to what I assumed was the correct climb-out attitude.
Based on my experience at lowland airports, I knew that 11 degrees
of nose-up attitude was usually just right for climb out. Following
my usual habit, I scanned the airspeed indicator after we had
climbed a few feet. To my horror, I observed that the airspeed
was decreasing rapidly. I immediately lowered the nose, and flew
the airplane in ground effect<A NAME="@default165"></A> while it regained speed. (What
had been intended as a short-field procedure ended with a peculiar
imitation of soft-field
procedure.) I used up almost the entire
runway getting back to 75 knots. At 75 knots I rotated again,
choosing a much lower pitch attitude this time. We climbed out
at 75 K<SUB><FONT SIZE=3>IAS</FONT></SUB> and the rest of the lesson was relatively uneventful.<BR>
<BR>
This situation is depicted in the following figures
and table. <A HREF="#fig-takeoff-low">Figure 2.7</A> shows the normal takeoff procedure
at a low-altitude airport. <A HREF="#fig-takeoff-wrong">Figure 2.8</A> shows that
using the normal pitch attitude does not produce the normal angle
of attack at a high-altitude airport, because the angle of climb
is an indispensable part of the equation. <A HREF="#fig-takeoff-right">Figure 2.9</A>
shows how to do it right. <A HREF="#tab-leadville-numbers">Table 2.2</A> summarizes the
arithmetic.<BR>

<A HREF="#tab-leadville-numbers">Table 2.2</A>: Right versus wrong climb attitude
</DIV>
</BLOCKQUOTE>Understanding what went wrong in this scenario is very
instructive. The main difference between a sea-level takeoff and a
mountain takeoff is that the airplane does not climb nearly so
steeply. The direction of flight is much more nearly horizontal. As
can be seen by comparing <A HREF="#fig-takeoff-wrong">figure 2.8</A> with
<A HREF="#fig-takeoff-right">figure 2.9</A>, this means a much lower pitch attitude is
needed to achieve the same angle of attack.<BR>
<BR>
The really embarrassing part of my story is that I had actually
calculated the climb gradient as part of my preflight preparation, to
make sure I could clear obstructions. I just didn't make the
connection between the climb gradient (which I calculated) the
best-climb angle of attack (which I knew) and the pitch attitude
(which I used for controlling the airplane). Fortunately I did know
the connection between airspeed and angle of attack, and I scanned the
airspeed indicator<A NAME="@default166"></A> before the situation got
too far out of hand.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="toc27"></A><a name="sec_power_attitude_performance"></a><A NAME="sec-power-attitude-performance"></A>
<H2><a href="#sec-power-attitude-performance">2.10</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Power plus Attitude does not equal Performance</H2>You may have heard the assertion that ``Power
plus Attitude equals Performance''. Well, that assertion
is not quite right, and has caused all sorts of unnecessary
confusion.<A NAME="@default167"></A><BR>
<BR>
Consider the following scenario: You are cruising along in a typical
180 horsepower, one-ton aircraft. You have constant power and
constant attitude<A NAME="@default168"></A>, so you expect constant
performance. You do indeed get constant performance, and everything
seems just fine.<BR>
<BR>
Now, just raise the nose to a 15 degree nose-up attitude,
and hold that attitude as accurately as you can. You will once
again have constant power and constant attitude, so you might
expect constant performance &#8212; but that is definitely not
what you will get. Instead, you will get decreasing airspeed and
increasing angle of attack. The initial climb that looked so
promising will peter out and you will wind up on the edge of a
stall.<BR>
<BR>
If you think about this situation in terms of <EM>energy</EM>
and <EM>angle of attack</EM>, the airplane's behavior is completely
predictable.<BR>
<BR>
First of all, we need to remember that not all climbs are steady
climbs. As portrayed in <A HREF="#fig-aoa-roller">figure 2.10</A>, it is possible for a
roller-coaster<A NAME="@default169"></A> with no engine at all to
zoom<A NAME="@default170"></A> up a little ways by cashing in its initial kinetic
energy. Just because it starts out on a certain climb trajectory
doesn't mean it can continue.<BR>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=center>
<a name="fig_aoa_roller"></a><A NAME="fig-aoa-roller"></A>
<IMG SRC="../gif48/aoa-roller.gif" alt=aoa-roller height=90 width=284><BR><A HREF="#fig-aoa-roller">Figure 2.10</A>: Climb Powered by Speed
</DIV>
<BR>
Airplanes, too, can be placed on climb<A NAME="@default171"></A> trajectories that cannot
be sustained by the available 
engine power. The initial climb succeeds only because airspeed
is being cashed in to purchase altitude.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike a roller-coaster, the airplane will not stay
on its initial trajectory until it runs out of speed altogether.
 As the airspeed decays, the airplane will have to fly at a higher
angle of attack in order to support its weight. Since, as discussed
above, the angle of attack depends on the angle between the pitch
attitude<A NAME="@default172"></A> and the direction of flight, a
constant attitude implies a non-constant direction of flight,
as indicated in <A HREF="#fig-chandelle">figure 2.11</A>.<BR>
<BR>

but Changing Performance
</DIV>
<BR>
If you are lucky, the changing flight path will result
in a trajectory where the rate of climb and the drag budget can
be sustained by engine power, with no further decrease of airspeed;
otherwise the maneuver will end in a stall.<BR>
<BR>
One of the maneuvers you have to perform in order to get a commercial
pilot certificate is called a <EM>chandelle</EM><A NAME="@default173"></A>. As
discussed in <A HREF="maneuver.html#sec-chandelle">section 16.11</A>, it involves turning as well as
climbing, but if you disregard the turning part, the maneuver is
exactly what is portrayed in <A HREF="#fig-chandelle">figure 2.11</A>. This maneuver is
an important part of the syllabus because it forces people to learn
that constant power and constant attitude do not imply constant
performance.<BR>
<BR>
As discussed in <A HREF="#sec-change-aoa">section 2.6</A>, a pitch
attitude excursion is not necessarily the same as an angle of
attack excursion. Suppose due to turbulence or whatever, the
pitch attitude and direction of flight both increase by 15 degrees.
 If you correct the situation promptly, the airspeed and altitude
will not have time to change much. If on the other hand you allow
the pitch excursion to persist, the airplane will begin to follow
the chandelle trajectory shown in <A HREF="#fig-chandelle">figure 2.11</A>. The
altitude will increase (at least at first), the airspeed will
decrease, and the angle of attack will increase. It is good pilot
technique to correct pitch attitude excursions before they turn
into altitude / airspeed / angle of attack excursions.<BR>
<BR>
To summarize: the Leadville scenario and the chandelle
scenario prove that angle of attack is far more important than
pitch attitude in determining performance. But this does not
mean you disregard pitch attitude &#8212; far from it. I recommend
that you use pitch attitude<A NAME="@default174"></A> as a
<EM>means</EM> of controlling angle of attack 
&#8212; just don't use pitch attitude as a <EM>substitute</EM> for controlling
angle of attack.<BR>

<H2><a href="#sec-perceive-wind">2.11</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Estimating the Relative Wind</H2>As discussed above, to control the angle of attack
you need to know both the pitch attitude and the direction of
flight<A NAME="@default175"></A>.<A NAME="text35" HREF="#note35"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>13</FONT></SUP></A> I have given several methods for estimating the
pitch attitude. Now it is time to explain how to estimate the
direction of the relative wind. This is almost the same thing
as estimating direction of flight.<BR>
<BR>
In level flight, the task is easy: The relative wind
is coming at you horizontally. (Again, I am assuming there are
no major updrafts or downdrafts.)<BR>
<BR>
If the airplane is climbing or descending, the origin
of the relative wind<A NAME="@default176"></A> will be above or below the
horizon, respectively. 
The amount above or below depends on the ratio of your vertical
speed to your airspeed. I have committed some of the numbers
to memory; for instance, I know that flying a standard 3 degree
glideslope at 90 knots involves a 480 fpm descent. Using the
same little fact in reverse tells me that if I am climbing out
at 90 knots and the vertical speed indicator<A NAME="@default177"></A> (VSI) is reporting
480 fpm, I must be flying toward a point 3 degrees above the horizon;
to say it the other way, the relative wind must be coming toward
me from that point, three degrees above the horizon. That means
that I can relabel the VSI as a ``direction of flight''
indicator, as shown in <A HREF="#fig-perceive-direction-vsi">figure 2.12</A>. Any
particular relabeling is only valid for one airspeed.<A NAME="text36" HREF="#note36"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>14</FONT></SUP></A><BR>

</DIV>
</BLOCKQUOTE>The VSI is not the only way of determining the direction of flight.
If you are established on an ILS approach<A NAME="@default180"></A>, as long as the glideslope
needle stays centered you are descending at a known angle (usually
three degrees). Similarly, there might be a VASI or other approach
slope indicator that you could follow. As always, it is better
to use outside references instead of instruments.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the best way to judge the angle of descent is to use the
``rule of thumb<A NAME="@default181"></A>'' as discussed
in <A HREF="landing.html#sec-thumb">section 12.3</A>. That frees you from relying on any fancy
equipment.<BR>
<BR>
If you control the direction of flight using any of these techniques,
and control the pitch attitude using the techniques discussed
elsewhere in this chapter, then you are also controlling the angle
of attack.<BR>
<BR>
Actually, there is one more ingredient in this recipe: the wind.
Three of the methods just mentioned (VASI,<A NAME="@default182"></A> electronic glideslope,<A NAME="@default183"></A> and
rule of thumb) give you information about your direction of flight
relative to the ground, but the angle of attack depends on your
direction of flight <EM>through the air</EM>. In the presence of wind,
the two are not quite the same. This is discussed in <A HREF="landing.html#sec-aoa-wind">section 12.4.3</A>.<BR>
<BR>
The scheme of estimating the direction of flight using the VSI
gives the correct answer even when nature's wind is blowing (provided,
again, there are no major updrafts or downdrafts).<A NAME="@default184"></A><BR>
<BR>
Outside references should be your primary means of controlling
angle of attack. Every so often you should look at the airspeed
indicator to make sure you have got the <EM>right</EM> angle of
attack (as discussed in <A HREF="#sec-ias-aoa">section 2.12</A>), but you should
maintain that angle of attack by outside references.<BR>
<BR>

instruments<A NAME="@default185"></A>; nine looks
out of ten, look at the outside references<A NAME="@default186"></A>.<BR>

<H3><font size=3><a href="#@default188">2.12.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Airspeed versus Coefficient of Lift</font></H3>So far in this chapter I have mentioned that the
critical performance numbers usually specified by airspeeds such
as <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>Y</FONT></SUB> are really angle of attack recommendations.<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI> I have mentioned that the trim wheel really controls
angle of attack but to a good approximation controls airspeed.
<LI> I have mentioned that the airspeed indicator
saved my bacon when I had an angle of attack problem at Leadville.
</UL>Therefore you are probably beginning to suspect that
there might be a relationship between angle of attack and airspeed<A NAME="@default189"></A>. That's right! The purpose of this section
is to tell you why you can use the airspeed indicator to control
angle of attack, when you have to compensate for its imperfections,
and when you can't trust it at all.<BR>
<BR>
The basic line of reasoning is this: the amount of
lift produced by the wing depends on angle of attack and calibrated
airspeed. We can turn this around to get a simple relationship
between airspeed and angle of attack (assuming lift is known,
as it usually is). The key formula is
<DIV ALIGN=center>
	lift = 
&frac12;
<FONT FACE=symbol>r</FONT><I>V</I><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUP>
	× coefficient of lift × area
<a name="eq_lift_key"></a><A NAME="eq-lift-key"></A>

<A NAME="@default197"></A>
<A NAME="@default198"></A>
<A NAME="@default199"></A>
<A NAME="@default200"></A>
The coefficient of lift will be discussed below, and (in more detail)
in <A HREF="4forces.html#sec-coeff-force-power">section 4.4</A>. The quantity 
&frac12;
<FONT FACE=symbol>r</FONT><I>V</I><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUP> is
called the <EM>dynamic pressure</EM><A NAME="@default201"></A>, also called <I>Q</I> for short, but more
often than not people just call it one-half rho vee squared. <BR>
<BR>
You
don't need to calculate 
&frac12;
<FONT FACE=symbol>r</FONT><I>V</I><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUP> because your airspeed
indicator does it for you. 
You may have thought that an airspeed
indicator would ideally measure the <EM>true airspeed</EM><A NAME="@default202"></A> (which is
simply the genuine speed of the air relative to the aircraft, denoted
<I>V</I> in all the formulas). However, the airspeed indicator doesn't
even try to measure <I>V</I> (i.e. the square root of <I>V</I><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUP>); instead
it tries to measure something called <EM>calibrated airspeed</EM><A NAME="@default203"></A> (CAS),
which is proportional to the square root of 
&frac12;
<FONT FACE=symbol>r</FONT><I>V</I><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUP>. Note
the factor of <FONT FACE=symbol>r</FONT> in the CAS formula.<A NAME="text38" HREF="#note38"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>16</FONT></SUP></A> While we're on the subject,
<EM>indicated airspeed</EM><A NAME="@default204"></A> (IAS) refers to whatever is indicated on
your airspeed indicator. It is the same as calibrated airspeed, plus
whatever errors there are in the mechanism. This discussion assumes
that your instrument is not too wildly inaccurate, so that formulas
that apply to CAS exactly also apply to IAS accurately enough for
present purposes.<A NAME="text39" HREF="#note39"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>17</FONT></SUP></A><BR>
<BR>
In flight, the lift is nearly always equal to the weight times
load factor<A NAME="@default205"></A>.<A NAME="text40" HREF="#note40"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>18</FONT></SUP></A> The weight is
presumably not changing much from moment to moment. This leads us to
rearrange the lift equation as follows:
<DIV ALIGN=center>
	coefficient of lift = 
	(weight × load factor) /
	(
&frac12;
<FONT FACE=symbol>r</FONT><I>V</I><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUP> × area)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<A HREF="#eq-lift-rearranged">2.2</A>)
</DIV>
If the airspeed goes down, the coefficient of lift must go up. This
relationship is illustrated in <A HREF="#fig-ias-cl">figure 2.13</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=center>

<BR>
Three of the critical <I>V</I>-numbers are marked in <A HREF="#fig-ias-cl">figure 2.13</A>;
each corresponds to a particular coefficient of lift.<BR>

of lift<A NAME="@default206"></A> is a simple function of the
angle of attack. This dependence is shown in <A HREF="#fig-cl-aoa">figure 2.14</A>.
Note that for small angles of attack, the coefficient
of lift is essentially proportional to the angle of attack. The
angle of attack that gives the maximum coefficient of lift is
called the ``critical angle of attack'' and is marked
in the figure. <BR>

</DIV>
<BR>
By combining this fact with what we already know,
we can establish the relationship between angle of attack and
indicated airspeed. We combine <A HREF="#fig-ias-cl">figure 2.13</A> with <A HREF="#fig-cl-aoa">figure 2.14</A>, as is done in <A HREF="#fig-ias-cl-aoa">figure 2.15</A>. We see that
a particular <I>V</I>-number, such as <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>NE</FONT></SUB>, corresponds
to a particular coefficient of lift, which in turn corresponds
to a certain angle of attack. The same goes for most of the other
<I>V</I>-numbers, such as <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>Y</FONT></SUB>. The argument works
in reverse, too: any particular angle of attack corresponds to
a particular airspeed (assuming we know how much lift is being
produced).<BR>
<BR>
We conclude that the airspeed indicator is really
a pretty good angle of attack indicator &#8212; with one major
exception. <BR>
<BR>
Here's the exception: There is a whole range of angles of attack near
the critical angle of attack that all produce about the same
coefficient of lift (because the coefficient of lift versus angle of
attack curve is quite flat on top). All the coefficient-of-lift
values in this small range correspond to nearly the same airspeed &#8212;
namely <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>S</FONT></SUB>, the stalling airspeed.<BR>
<BR>
The stall is a very critical flight regime. This
is a regime where you would very much like to have an accurate
instrument to indicate angle of attack, and alas it is the one
regime where the airspeed indicator doesn't tell you anything
you need to know.<BR>
<BR>
You want to land the airplane at a very high angle
of attack. You will have to perceive the angle of attack using
outside visual cues, as discussed in the previous sections. During
the flare, the airspeed indicator doesn't tell you anything you
need to know. I once asked an airline captain to tell me at what
airspeed his airliner touched down. He said ``I don't know;
I never looked. I've always had more important things to look
at''. That was a good pilot's honest answer.<BR>

<A NAME="@default207"></A>
<H3><font size=3><a href="#sec-density-speed">2.12.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Correcting for Reduced Density</font></H3>In all non-stalling regimes of flight, including
(especially) final approach, the airspeed indicator provides your
most quantitative information about angle of attack. We now discuss
some corrections that may be needed.<BR>
<BR>
The airspeed indicator is basically a pressure gauge; the pressure
that moves the airspeed needle is the same dynamic pressure that holds
up the wings in accordance with the lift formula (<A HREF="#eq-lift-key">equation 2.1</A>). Knowing the pressure that holds up the wing is more
important than knowing your true airspeed.<BR>
<BR>
The airspeed indicator is doing you a favor by not
measuring speed <EM>per se</EM>. For instance, on final approach
you should fly the proper indicated airspeed. At high density<A NAME="@default208"></A>
altitudes
this will be a higher-than-normal true airspeed. Remember that
calibrated airspeed is what holds up your wings. <BR>
<BR>
In other words: do not correct <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>X</FONT></SUB>, <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>Y</FONT></SUB>, <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>S</FONT></SUB>, or approach speed
(1.3 <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>S0</FONT></SUB>) for density altitude. Trust the calibrated airspeed.<BR>
<BR>
The true airspeed that corresponds to this calibrated airspeed will be
higher, by about 2% per thousand feet of density altitude. Your
groundspeed<A NAME="@default209"></A> will also be greater.<BR>
<BR>
When landing at a high-altitude airport, the greater groundspeed means
you will need more runway<A NAME="@default210"></A> length, by about 4% per thousand feet of
density altitude. Check the charts in your POH.<BR>
<BR>
A high-altitude takeoff is even worse than the landing, because the
engine (unless turbocharged) will be producing less power. Check the
charts in your POH. Apply a generous safety factor, since many of the
handbooks are disgracefully overoptimistic. Do the takeoff planning
(not just the landing planning) before you land, lest you go into an
airport you can't get out of.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="toc33"></A><a name="sec_weight_speed"></a><A NAME="sec-weight-speed"></A>
<H3><font size=3><a href="#sec-weight-speed">2.12.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Correcting for Reduced Lift Requirements</font></H3>So far we have been assuming the weight was equal to some standard
value. Let's relax that assumption and see what happens.<BR>
<BR>
As mentioned in <A HREF="power.html#sec-weight-effects">section 7.5.7</A>, it is easy to imagine
flying a Cherokee Six at half of its maximum legal weight.<BR>
<BR>
The problem is that the Pilot's Operating Handbook for the airplane
specifies all the critical angle of attack information in terms of
speeds &#8212; speeds that only apply at max weight. We know that the
airplane stalls at a definite angle of attack, not at a definite
airspeed or anything else.<BR>
<BR>
In general, if you keep the angle of attack constant and lower the
weight of the airplane by 10%, the airspeed needed to support that
weight goes down by 5%. This is because the lift depends on the
<EM>square</EM> of the airspeed in <A HREF="#eq-lift-key">equation 2.1</A>; the square
root of 0.90 is 0.95 and the square root of 1.10 is 1.05. For really
large changes in weight, the speed change is even somewhat greater;
the square root of 0.50 is not 0.75 but rather 0.707.<BR>
<BR>
At reduced weights, your approach speed and all the other critical
performance speeds must be reduced below their standard-weight
handbook values.<BR>
<BR>

<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#ffffd8">
The percentage change in speed<BR>is half of the percentage change in weight.
</TD>
</TR></TABLE></TD>
</TR></TABLE>
</DIV><BR>
Since the cruise speed depends on power and hardly depends on angle of
attack, it does <EM>not</EM> decrease as the weight is decreased; the
situation is depicted in <A HREF="power.html#fig-light-power">figure 7.13</A> in <A HREF="power.html#sec-weight-effects">section 7.5.7</A>. The maneuvering speed <EM>does</EM> decrease as
weight is decreased, as discussed in <A HREF="#sec-maneuvering-speed">section 2.13.2</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="toc34"></A><a name="sec_load_factor_speed"></a><A NAME="sec-load-factor-speed"></A>
<H3><font size=3><a href="#sec-load-factor-speed">2.12.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Correcting for Increased Lift Requirements</font></H3>There is one fairly common situation where maintaining a given angle
of attack requires flying at airspeeds <EM>above</EM> the <I>V</I>-numbers
given in the Pilot's Operating Handbook.<BR>
<BR>
In a steep turn, the wings are required to produce enough lift not
only to support the airplane's weight, but also to shove it around the
corner. In a 60 degree bank, the lift requirement is doubled. We say
there is a load factor<A NAME="@default211"></A> of 2.0. The airspeed necessary to produce
this lift at a given angle of attack is increased by a factor of
<font face=symbol>Ö</font>2, which is 1.41.<BR>
<BR>
If you are going to use the airspeed indicator as a source of angle of
attack information, you have to take this into account. If you fly at
a speed near the bottom of the green arc in a steep turn, the airplane
will stall. For example, if the airplane stalls at 60 knots in
unaccelerated flight, it will stall at 85 knots in a 60 degree banked
turn (since 60 ×
1.41 = 85).<BR>
<BR>
Also remember that the airplane is trimmed for a definite angle of
attack, and it really wants to maintain that angle of attack. If you
are cruising along, trimmed for 120 knots in straight and level
flight, and the airplane gets into a 60 degree bank, it will
accelerate to 169 knots (120 times the square root of 2) in order to
meet the increased lift requirement at the same angle of attack. This
situation is described in more detail in <A HREF="aoastab.html#sec-spiral-dive">section 6.2</A>.<BR>

final approach is 1.3 times the stalling speed.<A NAME="text41" HREF="#note41"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>19</FONT></SUP></A><BR>
<BR>
When applying this rule, a little sophistication is necessary, or you
might get into trouble. In particular, you must not just look at the
indicated stalling speed on the airspeed indicator, multiply by 1.3,
and then try to use the result as your indicated airspeed on final.<BR>
<BR>
The only safe way to calculate the approach speed is to multiply the
<EM>calibrated</EM> stalling speed by 1.3, and then convert the result an

</DIV>
</BLOCKQUOTE>The origin of the problem is this: It is possible to position the
Pitot tube<A NAME="@default216"></A> and static port<A NAME="@default217"></A>
so that the IAS is a few knots
higher than the CAS in cruise conditions, yet a few knots
lower<A NAME="@default218"></A> than the CAS near the stall. Manufacturers commonly do this,
presumably in hopes of making pilots think the airplane performs
better than it really does.<BR>
<BR>
These errors would not be much of a problem if the the IAS were simply
proportional to the CAS. The constant of proportionality would drop out
of the calculation, and you could skip steps (a) and (c). Alas, in
many airplanes the errors are highly nonlinear. The indicated
airspeeds are much too low at the low end of the scale. If you
multiply such a low number by 1.3, you get a number that is still much
too low, but falls at a place where the gauge is more accurate, so you
wind up with a real airspeed that is dangerously low.<BR>
<BR>
You may we wondering about other calculations, such as the corrections
for nonstandard weight. Should calculations also be done using
calibrated airspeed? The answer, alas, is not 100% obvious. It
depends on whether you think the errors in the system depend on
airspeed itself, or depend on angle of attack. 
<UL>
<LI>
  In the rather unlikely case that the error is in the gauge
itself, it would be better to convert to CAS, multiply, and convert
back to IAS.
<LI> More often, the airspeed instrument itself is a very accurate
pressure gauge, but the Pitot and static ports are positioned so that
they pick up bogus pressures at high angles of attack. In such a case
you should calculate the weight-correction using indicated airspeed
directly. That is, if you are at 64% of standard weight, your
indicated airspeed should be 80% of the standard indicated airspeed.
The point is that you want to fly the maneuver at the correct angle of
attack. If the errors depend only on angle of attack, they drop out
of this calculation.
</UL>You might want to measure your airplane, as follows: Fly it at its
maximum weight, at a safe altitude, and observe the indicated airspeed
at which the stall warning horn comes on. Do this in the clean
configuration and in the landing configuration. Then repeat the
measurements at the lowest convenient weight. Then you will know for
sure how the indicated airspeed varies with weight, at particular

<H3><font size=3><a href="#sec-correcting-ias-slip">2.12.7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Correcting for Slip</font></H3>It is easy to get into situations where the indicated airspeed is
wildly inaccurate. In some airplanes the opening that is supposed to
measure the static pressure<A NAME="@default220"></A> is located on the side of the fuselage,
and during a slip that point is subject to some dynamic
pressure in addition to the static pressure.<A NAME="text42" HREF="#note42"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>20</FONT></SUP></A><BR>
<BR>
In such a case you must remember that it is angle of attack that
really matters. You can use the airspeed indicator if you wish
<EM>before</EM> the slip to help figure out what angle of attack you want, but
<EM>during</EM> the slip you must maintain that angle of attack by
looking at the angles themselves (pitch angle and direction of
flight). See <A HREF="snaps.html#sec-intentional-slip">section 11.2</A> for more on this.<BR>

<H3><font size=3><a href="#sec-weight-drag-speed">2.12.8</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Drag and Lift-to-Drag Ratio</font></H3>Let's return to the scenario of the airplane flying
at half of its standard weight<A NAME="@default221"></A>, and ask (a) what is the best glide speed,
and (b) how well will it glide at that speed.<BR>
<BR>
To answer these questions we need to think about
drag as well as lift. (<A HREF="#sec-weight-speed">Section 2.12.4</A> concentrated
on topics like <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>S</FONT></SUB> and <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A</FONT></SUB> which
depend on total lift, not lift-to-drag ratio<A NAME="@default222"></A>.) Fortunately, the answer comes out the same. This is
because the formula for drag,
<DIV ALIGN=center>
	drag = 
&frac12;
<FONT FACE=symbol>r</FONT><I>V</I><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUP> × 
	coefficient of drag × area
<a name="eq_drag_famous"></a><A NAME="eq-drag-famous"></A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<A HREF="#eq-drag-famous">2.3</A>)
</DIV>
has the same form as the famous formula for lift:
<DIV ALIGN=center>
	lift = 
&frac12;
<FONT FACE=symbol>r</FONT><I>V</I><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUP> × 
	coefficient of lift × area
<a name="eq_lift_famous"></a><A NAME="eq-lift-famous"></A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<A HREF="#eq-lift-famous">2.4</A>)
</DIV>
The key idea is that the coefficient of drag<A NAME="@default223"></A> depends
on angle of attack; at any particular angle of attack the coefficient does
not perceptibly depend on weight or airspeed. The same is true
of the coefficient of lift and the lift-to-drag ratio.<BR>
<BR>
If you want to glide<A NAME="@default224"></A> from point <I>A</I> to point <I>B</I> in no-wind
conditions,<A NAME="text43" HREF="#note43"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>21</FONT></SUP></A> the main thing you care about is
lift-to-drag ratio. For example, if your airplane is capable
of a 10-to-1 lift-to-drag ratio, then you can glide to a point
that is 1/10th of a radian (i.e. six degrees) below the horizon.<BR>
<BR>
The optimal lift-to-drag ratio is achieved at a definite
angle of attack. To support the weight of the airplane at that
angle of attack, you will need to fly at a speed proportional
to the square root of the weight, for the reasons given in <A HREF="#sec-weight-speed">section 2.12.4</A>.<BR>
<BR>
The lightly-loaded gliding airplane will have the
same angle of descent, the same direction of flight, and the same
total gliding distance, as indicated in <A HREF="#fig-weighted-glider">figure 2.16</A>.
 The only difference is that it will have a slower descent rate
and a slower forward speed; this is indicated in the figure by
stopwatches that show how long it takes the plane to reach a particular
point.<BR>

<BR>
The moral of the story is if you are flying a lightly-loaded airplane,
you should fly it ``by the<A NAME="@default225"></A> numbers'',
namely the angle of attack numbers. The critical airspeed numbers
(climb speed, approach speed, stalling speed, etc.) are all reduced
according to half the weight-change percentage. That is, if you are
10% light, reduce the handbook speeds by 5%.<BR>
<BR>
There is one well-known exception to the rule of
thumb that says important performance speeds decrease as the weight
decreases. That is, the cruising speed actually increases at
reduced weights. This is not an exception to the real rule that
speeds should vary with weight <EM>at a given angle of attack,</EM>
because cruising speed is not tied to a particular angle of
attack. If the airplane is lightly loaded, you can cruise at
a lower angle of attack and a higher airspeed, since the wings
need to do less work to support the weight of airplane.<BR>

<H3><font size=3><a href="#sec-explicit-airspeeds">2.13.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Explicit Airspeed Limits</font></H3>There is a <EM>normal-operations</EM> airspeed, <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>NO</FONT></SUB>. This is
indicated by the top of the green arc on the airspeed indicator. You
should not exceed this speed except in smooth air, and then only with
caution. The idea here is that you don't want to break the wing.
There is a maximum coefficient of lift, and the lift force depends on
this coefficient times calibrated airspeed squared. By limiting the

</TR></TABLE>
</DIV><BR>
We say it is <EM>supposed</EM> to stall, not guaranteed to stall, because
the formal definition of <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A</FONT></SUB> takes into account only certain types
of rough control usage, and only certain types of turbulence (namely
purely vertical updrafts and downdrafts). In real life, other
possibilities must be considered. For instance, if you start out at
<I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A</FONT></SUB> and encounter a large horizontal wind shear, arbitrarily large
forces can be developed. For this and several other reasons, the
exact value of <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A</FONT></SUB> should not be taken too literally.<BR>
<BR>
Still, the general idea of <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A</FONT></SUB> makes sense: If you observe or
anticipate a situation that imposes large <I>G</I> loads on the airplane,
you should slow down and/or confine yourself to gentler maneuvers.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="@default231"></A>
Unlike <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>NO</FONT></SUB>, the maneuvering speed varies in proportion to the
square root of the mass of the airplane. The reason for this is a bit
tricky. The trick is that <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A</FONT></SUB> is not a force limit but rather an
<EM>acceleration</EM> limit. When the manufacturers determine a value for
<I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A</FONT></SUB>, they are not worried about breaking the wing, but are worried
about breaking <EM>other</EM> important parts of the airplane, such as
the engine mounts. These items don't directly care how much force the
wing is producing; they just care about the acceleration they are
undergoing.<BR>
<BR>
By increasing the mass of the airplane, you decrease the overall
acceleration that results from any overall force. (Of course, if you
increase the mass of cargo, it increases the stress on the
cargo-compartment floor &#8212; but it decreases the stress on unrelated
components such as engine mounts, because the acceleration is less.)<BR>
<BR>
This means you should put <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A</FONT></SUB> along with <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>S</FONT></SUB> and <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>Y</FONT></SUB> etc. on
your list of critical airspeeds that vary in proportion to the square
root of the mass of the airplane. However, <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A</FONT></SUB> depends on real
<EM>mass</EM> not on weight, so unlike the others it does <EM>not</EM>
increase with load factor. <BR>
<BR>
To illustrate this point, consider what happens when the airplane is
in a steep turn. Compared to unaccelerated flight:<BR>
<BR>
<OL type=1>
<LI>
  The stalling speed increases (because the stalling angle
of attack stays the same), and
<LI> the airspeed for best rate of climb increases (because the
optimum angle of attack stays the same), but
<LI> the maneuvering speed remains the same (since it doesn't
directly depend on angle of attack).
</OL>Finally, we should note that there are two different concepts that,
loosely speaking, are called maneuvering speeds. <BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>
  The <EM>design</EM> maneuvering speed, which we can denote
 <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A(D)</FONT></SUB>, is primarily of interest to aircraft designers, not
 pilots. The designer must choose a value for <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A(D)</FONT></SUB> and then
 build an aircraft strong enough to withstand certain stressful
 maneuvers at that speed. Higher values of <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A(D)</FONT></SUB> promote safety,
 by forcing the design to be stronger.
<LI> The maneuvering speed <EM>limitation</EM>, which we can denote
 <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A(L)</FONT></SUB>, is of interest to pilots. It is an operating limitation.
 It appears on a placard in the cockpit. Lower values of <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A(L)</FONT></SUB>
 promote safety, by restricting certain operations to lower,
 less-stressful airspeeds. 
</UL>This is a book for pilots, not designers, so when we use <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A</FONT></SUB> it
always means <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A(L)</FONT></SUB>. But you should be careful when reading the

<LI>
  The low-speed limits and most of the ``optimum''
numbers (including the stall, best rate of climb, best lift/drag
ratio, best endurance, normal approach, short field approach,
etc.) involve, to an excellent approximation, definite angles
of attack. The corresponding airspeeds vary in proportion to
the square root of weight. (To a second approximation each of
these angles of attack will change slightly because of propwash
over the wings, propeller efficiency, and other factors that depend
on speed and power.)
 <A NAME="@default232"></A>
 <A NAME="@default233"></A>
<LI> The high-speed limits (including never-exceed

limit etc.) are, for all practical purposes, definite indicated
airspeeds.
<LI> The maneuvering limit is not exactly a definite
speed (since the limiting speed varies in proportion to the square
root of mass) but it is not exactly a definite angle of attack
either (since <I>V</I><SUB><FONT SIZE=2>A</FONT></SUB> does not depend on load factor in a steep
turn).
<LI> Top speed and normal cruise speed depend on weight and engine
power, as discussed in <A HREF="power.html#sec-cruise-speed">section 7.6.5</A>. They also depend on
density altitude, as discussed in <A HREF="power.html#sec-power-altitude">section 7.5.4</A>. Best

<H2><a href="#sec-raoa-aaoa">2.14</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Relative versus Absolute Angle of Attack</H2>You can skip this section unless you are trying to compare this book
with another book that uses a different definition of ``the'' angle of
attack.<BR>
<BR>
As mentioned in connection with <A HREF="#fig-aoa-def2">figure 2.1</A>, we are free to
choose how the angle-of-attack reference stick is aligned relative to
the rest of the wing. Throughout this book, we choose to align it so
that zero angle of attack corresponds to zero coefficient of lift.
According to the standard terminology, the angle measured relative to
the zero-lift direction<A NAME="@default235"></A> is called the <EM>relative</EM> angle of
attack.<BR>
<BR>
Some other books try to align the reference with the chord
line<A NAME="text44" HREF="#note44"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>22</FONT></SUP></A> of the wing. According to the
standard terminology, the angle measured relative to chord line is
called the <EM>absolute</EM> angle of attack.<BR>
<BR>
If you try to compare books, there is potential for confusion, because
this book uses ``angle of attack'' as shorthand for relative angle of
attack, while some other books use the same term as shorthand for
absolute angle of attack. To make sense when comparing books, you
must do away with all the shorthand and use the fully explicit terms.
In particular:

where -<I>k</I> is the <I>X</I>-intercept of the graph of coefficient of lift
versus absolute angle of attack, when graphed using whatever reference
the other book is using to define absolute angle of attack. The
<I>X</I>-intercept is always zero in this book.<BR>
<BR>
Note that the names ``absolute'' versus ``relative'' don't mean anything.
Neither quantity is more absolute or more relative than the other.<BR>
<BR>
Also note that are not just two possibilities; the choice of
reference is really quite arbitrary. It is perfectly valid to measure
angles relative to the bottom surface of the wing, or the long axis of
the fuselage, or any other reference you choose, provided you
are consistent about it.<BR>
<BR>
Using the chord as a reference works OK if you are only talking about
one <EM>section</EM> of a <EM>plain</EM> wing. On the other hand:
<UL>
<LI>
  On typical airplanes, the chord of the wing tip points in a
different direction from the chord of the wing root. Which one
should be considered ``the'' reference?
<LI> When you extend the flaps, the chord line obviously
changes. (See <A HREF="vdamp.html#sec-more-rdamp">section 5.4.3</A> for more on this.)
Oddly, most books continue to measure angles relative to where
the chord of the unflapped wing would have been. This
makes the experiments easier. It is mostly harmless. It certainly
highlights the arbitrariness of the choice of reference.

The simple rule ``pitch plus incidence equals angle of attack plus
angle of incidence'' (<A HREF="#fig-incidence">figure 2.2</A>) is always technically
valid (because the arbitrariness in the angle of incidence cancels the
arbitrariness in the angle of attack). But if you want the rule to be
<EM>useful</EM> in situations where flap settings are changing, you need
to choose <EM>relative</EM> angle of attack or 
something very similar; otherwise you don't know what angle of attack
